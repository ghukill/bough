bough - a tale of time
====

The pines sway with a morning breeze that comes rolling off the Pacific ocean.  You are standing in a patch of sun on a bluff, a hundred feet or so above a beach filled with kelp, scuttling hermit crabs, sea foam, sea spray, sea smells, and seashells.  It's not quite 8am yet, and you've got a cup of coffee in your hand.

To take the switchbacking trail on your right that goes down to the beach, `git checkout trail`.

To turn around and walk inland, `git checkout inland`.
